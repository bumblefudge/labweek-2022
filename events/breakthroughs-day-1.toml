Join us for a live virtual talk and conversation from Foresight Institute's Allison Duettmann on the technological reasons for existential hope. From brain computer interfaces to crypto-commerce to robotics, Allison sits at the intersection of many of these trends and is working to coordinate these factors towards flourishing futures. Allison will deliver a talk and then sit down with a conversation with Protocol Labs' Founder Juan Benet, and finally the audience will have the opportunity to ask questions and interact with the speakers.
